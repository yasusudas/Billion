## Checkout activation

Hosted checkout URLs are not embedded yet. The checkout connection is prepared
as a guarded static replacement flow:

- `checkout/activation-spec.md` defines the product-to-success-URL map.
- `checkout/checkout-links.example.json` is the safe manifest template.
- `scripts/validate-checkout-links.mjs` checks business name, product IDs,
  exact JPY amounts, Stripe-hosted HTTPS URLs, and key-like private values.
- `scripts/apply-checkout-links.mjs` replaces only disabled purchase CTAs with
  matching product sections after validation passes.

Use a local manifest named `checkout/checkout-links.local.json` for real hosted
checkout URLs. That file is ignored by this project so private setup notes
are not accidentally committed. Public hosted checkout URLs may appear in the
generated HTML only after account-owner activation and validation.

Hosted checkout links are intentionally not embedded until the payment account owner completes payout, identity, tax, and legal-display setup in the payment provider.

Delivery pages are public, noindex delivery manifests for hosted-checkout success redirects. Full paid delivery files should remain outside this public verification repository while hosted checkout and fulfillment are pending.

The public storefront does not link directly to delivery downloads. Static success URLs are still not authentication; use hosted checkout or a dedicated delivery service if stronger access control is required.

`robots.txt` disallows `/checkout/`, `/delivery/`, `/products/`, and `/scripts/`.
`vercel.json` redirects `/products` and `/products/*` to `/delivery-access` as an
extra deployment-level guard if stale or accidental product paths exist on a
hosting target.
`.vercelignore` excludes `products/**` and `checkout/checkout-links.local.json`
to reduce CLI misdeploy risk from this local working directory.

Run the static public-site regression check before publishing:

```bash
node scripts/verify-public-site.mjs
```

Run the live production regression check after Vercel reflects `main`:

```bash
node scripts/verify-live-production.mjs --expect-checkout pending
```
